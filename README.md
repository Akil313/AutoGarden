# AutoGarden
A project to create an IoT system that uses a Raspberry pi to control a motor and other sensors to pump waste water to a plant. This project is meant for me to learn about frameworks and knowledge that is useful to the field of IoT, Robotics and Machine Learning such as Johnny-Five, SocketsIO and Node.js
